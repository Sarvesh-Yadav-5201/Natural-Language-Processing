It involves mapping each word to a vector of real numbers, such that the vectors capture the meaning and context of the words.\n","\n","* Word embedding works by analyzing large collections of text data and learning the relationships between words. This is done through a process called training, where an algorithm iteratively adjusts the vector representations of words in a way that maximizes their predictive power for a given task.\n","\n","* The resulting word embeddings can be used in a wide range of NLP applications, including text classification, language translation, and sentiment analysis. They allow machine learning models to better understand the meaning and context of words, which can lead to more accurate and effective analysis of text data."],"metadata":{"id":"wtSnqA-SoSrk"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"9lvJO7xroGOp"},"outputs":[],"source":["# importing libraries \n","import numpy as np\n","import nltk\n","import re\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import one_hot\n","\n","\n","# nltk.download('punkt')\n","# nltk.download('stopwords')\n","# nltk.download('wordnet')\n","# nltk.download('omw-1.4')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["paragraph =  '''The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a form of electromagnetic radiation that pervades the entire universe.
