Word2Vec is based on the idea that the meaning of a word can be inferred from the context in which it appears, and it uses a neural network to learn vector representations for each word in a text corpus.\n","\n","* The main difference between Word2Vec and traditional bag-of-words and TF-IDF approaches is that Word2Vec is a more sophisticated way of representing words that captures the semantic relationships between them. In the bag-of-words model, words are represented as individual tokens with no relation to each other. TF-IDF, on the other hand, takes into account the frequency of words in a document and the inverse frequency of those words across the entire corpus.\n","\n","* Word2Vec, by contrast, takes into account the context in which a word appears and learns a high-dimensional vector representation for each word based on the relationships between the words in the corpus. This allows Word2Vec to capture more nuanced relationships between words, such as synonyms and antonyms, and to perform better on tasks such as language modeling, semantic similarity, and text classification."],"metadata":{"id":"hKDAdVs90eIV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# importing Libraries :\n","import nltk\n","import re\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n","\n","from gensim.models import Word2Vec"],"metadata":{"id":"oCx20pG_0dzA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1678305968810,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3199,"user":{"displayName":"SARVESH YADAV","userId":"08025523922383380882"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4ew-9Jc30OTs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1678305980890,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2375,"user":{"displayName":"SARVESH YADAV","userId":"08025523922383380882"}},"outputId":"805066ef-5e94-4653-e13e-9d3353a872e9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping tokenizers/punkt.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/stopwords.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package omw-1.4 to /root/nltk_data...\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}],"source":["nltk.download('punkt')\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","nltk.download('wordnet')\n","nltk.download('omw-1.4')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# We will be working on the same Paragraph we were using till now:\n","\n","paragraph  = '''The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a form of electromagnetic radiation that pervades the entire universe.
