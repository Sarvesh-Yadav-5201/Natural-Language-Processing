### <b> In this git-hub repo, we will be using NLP techniques to perform text classification. We have a dataset of customer reviews of a product, and we want to classify each review as positive or negative. We will use various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and feature extraction to process the text data. We will then train a machine learning model to classify each review as positive or negative based on its features.
#### Jupyter Notebooks are Self-Explanatory here.
