> <b> Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret, understand, and generate human language. It involves using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and manipulate natural language data, such as text and speech.

NLP has various applications, including but not limited to:

>* Sentiment analysis - analyzing text to determine the writer's attitude, emotion, and opinions.
>* Machine translation - translating text from one language to another using computational methods.
>* Chatbots - creating conversational agents that can understand and respond to user inputs in natural language.
>* Information retrieval - extracting relevant information from text documents to answer user queries.
>* Text classification - categorizing text documents based on their content or topic.

  
### By using NLP techniques, one can automate the process of categorizing customer reviews, which can be time-consuming and error-prone if done manually. This can help businesses gain insights into customer feedback and improve their products and services accordingly.
