# <b> PROJECT: Predicting Stock Prices using Stacked LSTM Model
  _____________________
  
  ## Walkthrough:
  >* Collect stock data using an API
  >* Pre-process the data by splitting it into training and test sets, standardizing it, and converting it into a dataset matrix
  >* Create a Stacked LSTM model to predict stock prices
  >* Evaluate the model's performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  >* Forecast stock prices for the next 30 days.
  
  ## Libraries and Technologies used:
  The following libraries and technologies have been used in this project:

  >* Pandas-datareader
  >* Numpy
  >* Pandas
  >* Matplotlib
  >* Keras (tensorflow backend)
  >* Scikit-learn
  
  ## Results and Accuracy:
  >* Successfully predicted stock prices on test data.
  >* Forecasted stock prices for the next 30 days.
  >* The performance of the model was evaluated using Root mean squared error.
  >* The model can be used to predict and forecast the trend of stock prices.
  
  ## How to run the file:
  To run this project, follow these steps:

  >* Install the necessary libraries by running '!pip install pandas-datareader numpy pandas matplotlib keras scikit-learn'.
  >* Download the Jupyter Notebook file from the repository.
  >* Open the Jupyter Notebook file and run the cells in the same order as they appear in the notebook.
  >* The final output will be the predicted stock price for the next 30 days.
