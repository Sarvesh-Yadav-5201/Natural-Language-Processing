# <b> Stock Sentiment Analysis
______________________
  
  ##  OBJECTIVE:
  > * The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the direction of stock price movements for a given company. The model utilizes advanced sentiment analysis techniques to analyze news articles and social media posts, and outputs a binary prediction of whether the stock price will increase or decrease.
  
  ## Walkthrough: 
  > The project has been divided into the following steps:
  >
   > * Importing the necessary libraries
   > * Downloading the dataset
   > * Pre-processing the data
   > * Vectorizing the data using TfidfVectorizer
   > * Training the model using Random Forest Classifier
   > * Evaluating the model's accuracy on the test set
  
  ## Technologies/Libraries Used:
  > The project is implemented using the following technologies/libraries:
  >
  >  *  Python
  >  *  Pandas
  >  *  Regular expressions (re)
  >  *  Scikit-learn
  >  *  TfidfVectorizer
  >  *  MultinomialNB
  >  *  RandomForestClassifier
  
  ## Results and Accuracy:
  
  > Two methods were used for this project:

  > * Pre-processing the entire time series data set at once, which resulted in an accuracy of 52% using both Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier.
  > * Pre-processing the train and test data separately, which resulted in an accuracy of 83% on the test set using Random Forest Classifier.
  
  ## How to Use the Code:
  
   >  To use the code, follow these steps:

   > * Clone the repository to your local machine.
   > * Install the required libraries.
   > * Run the code using a Python IDE or the command line.
   > * You can modify the code and dataset to train the model on your own data.
