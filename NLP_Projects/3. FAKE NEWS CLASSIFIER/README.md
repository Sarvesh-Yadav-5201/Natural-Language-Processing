# <b> Fake News Classifier (Using Bag-of-Words)
______________
  
  ## OBJECTIVE:
  > The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify news articles as fake or not using bag-of-words approach.
  
  ## Walkthrough:
  > * Pre-process data using stopwords and stemming.
  > * Perform bag-of-words analysis to get top occurring words/features.
  > * Train and test the model using multiple algorithms including Naive Bayes, Multinomial Algorithm with Hyper-parameter, Passive Aggressive Classifier, and Random Forest Model.
  
  ## Technologies/ Libraries Used:
  >* Python
  >* Pandas
  >* Numpy
  >* NLTK
  >* Scikit-learn
  
  ## Results and Accuracy:

  > Random Forest Model gives the highest accuracy of 95% compared to the other models.
  
  ## How to use the code:

   >* Download the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data#).
   >* Install the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.
   >* Run the code in a Python IDE or notebook.
   >* The code provides a function to predict whether a news article is fake or real based on input text.
