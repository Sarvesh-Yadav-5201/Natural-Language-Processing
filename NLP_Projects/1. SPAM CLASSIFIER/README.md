# <b> SPAM-ify: Catching spam messages like a pro! </b>
____

## <b> OBJECTIVE: 
  > * SPAM-ify is a powerful spam classifier that uses natural language processing techniques to accurately identify spam messages in SMS texts. Our objective is to train a machine learning model that can distinguish between spam and non-spam messages with exceptional accuracy.
 
## <b> Walkthrough:
  > * The Project includes several key steps,  including data cleaning and preprocessing, bag of words feature extraction, and model prediction using a Naive Bayes classifier. Our final model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99% in identifying spam messages.
  
## Usage: 
  > * To use SPAM-ify, simply clone our repository and run the spam_classifier.ipynb  to train the model and generate predictions on test data.
  
## Requirements:
> To run SPAM-ify, you will need:
>
>  * Python 3.6 or higher
>  * Pandas
>  * NumPy
>  * NLTK
