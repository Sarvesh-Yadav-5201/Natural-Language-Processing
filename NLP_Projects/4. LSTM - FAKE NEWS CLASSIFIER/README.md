# <b> PROJECT: Detecting Fake News with LSTM and Word Embedding
  ______________
  ## OBJECTIVE: 
  >* The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model using LSTM and word embedding techniques that can classify news articles as fake or not fake with high accuracy.

  ## Walkthrough:
  >* Importing the necessary libraries
  >* Getting the dataset
  >* Cleaning the texts and performing word embedding using Tensorflow
  >* One-hot representation
  >* Embedding representation
  >* Initiating the model
  >* Training the model
  
  ## Libraries and Technologies Used:
  >* Pandas
  >* Numpy
  >* Regular Expressions (re)
  >* Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)
  >* Tensorflow
  >* Keras
  
  ## Results and Accuracy:
  > The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 92% in classifying fake news. This was determined by evaluating the model on a validation set after training. The accuracy is a measure of the percentage of correctly classified instances out of all instances. Therefore, the model correctly classified 92% of the news articles as either fake or not. This is a good result and indicates that the model is effective in distinguishing between fake and real news.
  
  ## How to Use the Code:
  >* Download and install the necessary libraries
  >* Download the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data#)
  >* Run the code in a Python environment
